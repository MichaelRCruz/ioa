A particular interest was taken with ioa's authentication system whereby a common list of user configurations serves as the source of truth for any user intent. Since ioa's design allows the user to select several [auth](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) providers associated with their account, the thought was to utilize any tokens or keys made avaiable by each of those potential auth choices to the user's advantage.

For example, integrate a [mini app](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/mini-apps)!

This way, all communication outside of the ioa system is done on the user's accord and paves the way for end-to-end encryption. The real value this approach yields, appears to be the scaleability it produces for the system surrounding it. The list of user configurations is able to serve as a centralized source of truth for, not only ioa, but also any affiliate iOS, Android, or web application under the same project ID. It still remains unclear how flexible the scope each app has with respect to the location of ioa in the Firebase [SuperSystem](https://ioa.is). This idea has been done already, but ioa's significance is characterized by the user-friendliness and speed of development. Firebase makes these opportunities available for less complex systems, like ioa, and helps with the overall distribution of [information](https://google.com).

So far, limited precautions have been made to handle three distinct abstract concepts: state, null, error.

## _state

The most frequently consumed resource is a message which is created via the standard .map() technique in any functional or class component. This is _potentially_ the most brittle part of the app, but also where ioa gets it's strength. Basically, when ioa will [Juice It or Lose It](https://youtu.be/YOETTBL3yZ4).

The authentication state of ioa should remain completely out of any other state's lifecycle exclusively due to the fact that it is not "spawned" from that lifecycle process and, in other words, only by virtue of that fact. If not, then somewhere in the n + 1 future your set of enclosed lifecycle events will behave in ways that are difficult to understand.

## _null

There is still some thought needed regarding the 

## _error
