A **Satelite Application** (sa) is any application that depends on the set of user configurations provided, created, and maintained by ioa. This implies that both ioa and all of its satelite applications share the same [project ID]().

The above [hanger]() lists a set of satelite applications whereby the naming convention encourages developer awareness of the logistical challenges of any network.

## Time | moment.js

A good fit for ioa and a common helper for this sort of thing appears to be [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/). This third-party library was one of the first significant dependecies listed in ioa's package.json and is the crux of the component, [timeago.js]().
