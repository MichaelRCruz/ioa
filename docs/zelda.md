# Zelda

Have you ever mistaken Zelda for the hero, looked closer, then learned about Link? Are you familiar with the concept of a url shortener? Lastly, what if I told you about the seemingly infinite value of a domain I purchased some time ago? It took a while for me to see past its aesthetic value and into utility, but it is there.

As a challenge, a way to impress someone else, and to look better for any potential employer, came this project that brought me out of my comfort zone. The demonstration was to do something the other way. That is how the emoji url shortener was conceived, built, and archived just before completion. The idea was infinitely improvable so a step-sideways got me around that one. All for a reason.

There is more practicality in finding a team of engineers to build this because one engineer can spend a lifetime of keeping it, not only practical, but also relevant in time. The concepts of this idea have been improved upon almost automatically in the industry. You can see this in the companies that have them today. Almost all of them do.

What they do not have is my domain.

There is the feeling that tells me several of the tech companies out there knew about my ownership of this and a particular penpal at Google confirmed the validity of the idea. The situation mow is that I am in no capacity to begin working on this until there is some kind of investment made up front.

One reason is I need to get out of this motel. The real reason is I want a family. As dramatic as that sounds, it is still the ultimate motivation for what I do. What else is there?

Let me tell you about the power of tis namespace. You could build a new index of anything, but from scratch. This gets you out of, more than technical debt, it ultimately resets all limitations that your competitors are struggling with.

Are you familiar with the story of Warby Parker? They were this highly anticipated thing, but was not the first to market. They were like Apple - always late to the party, but the one best dressed. Think of my domain like that except the party was a fashion show and everyone else thought it was happy-hour.

So, can someone just buy this ting from me or pay me to make it happen so I can have a family?
