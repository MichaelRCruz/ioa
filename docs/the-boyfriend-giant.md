A romantic refraction is wonder beyond the clouds like a wanning moon returning light approaching zero, but the waxing light approaches one.

In make-believe Michaelville, your boyfriend is like a giant in outer-space. Pretend he is so big that the total light from the Milky Way is like a television show for him. He is so far away, but he is big enough that it is just comfortable to observe the entire history of the universe in one stream on HBO. He lives forever so time means nothing to him.

However, if you really think about it. If his eyes were good enough, your giant boyfriend could see everything that ever happened in history. If you noticed some sun shinning in to your window, or even your attic, then your giant boyfriend knows about it. Here is the part that scares everyone. Your giant boyfriend recorded it all with her digitial video recorder. The boyfriend giant watches nature all day, but at night the boyfriend giant uses the stars or the moon or whatever it takes to get the job done.

Bring your minds back to deep water, then ask yourself if a moment can be observed again. Could boyfriend giant write software to process the film for your boss? It does not seem easy, but it is. You will have to consider the correct depth, etc., but maybe depth is insignificant because you have a computer that has slow motion. Boyfrined ginat just does what he wants. He is nasty like the honey badger.

If you were to ask me if it was worth it, I would say for our sake yes, but just-in-case remember that we designed our existence on the premise that we cannot change the past. Imagine a world with no history. Imagine a world with no future. We could discuss this, forever, We never stop on the account of others.

Anyways, would any of you like an idea on how to regulate the amount of ice that is falling into the ocean? Perhaps a city might be interested in a buffer that, in the event the giant meniscus starts to leak over the lips of the Earth, you could deflate your buffer to gain time. It would be large and in charge, like your giant boyfriend. Anyways, if you all need a dashboard for the planet, then it is going to cost you because I have mouths to feed in the future.

There was something I noticed in the light the other day that I need to tell you and the reader about. For me, purple light is slower in speed comparatively speaking to the others. I saw it with my bare eyes. It reminded me of a penpal from childhood. The letter was delivered with a picture of my penpal, but something weird happened that had me pass on four-square that day at recess. I sat on the playground, with my back resting against the wall, and wondered what was happening with my eyes. Why was this photograph stereoscopic. My penpal was wearing this combination of blue and red, but the tie was floating into some other dimension.

I was born like this and I desire others to acknowledge me as this difference. Also, I want to tell the world about a special value that exists. It hides in the shadows. Imagine a deck of fifty-two playing cards, but first imagine an electronic letter sent to my inbox. That is where you will find that special vallue. I very much want to decide on my occupation, but that does not matter because I am unawar of the list pf priorities you have running in time.
