In Marina Del Rey, there is this place called Mothers Beach. On this beach are two bathrroms, a mens and a womans, but there is funky light coming out of it. Down the road in one direction is a convenience store and in the other direction is a Hotel. They would not let me in there, but I say outside it as if it was my one chance at luxury. It would have been like the Grand Budapest Hotel in my imagination.

There was a princess in there, for real, and that was the place my heart told me to go. I never made it in, but the complexities in the world at the time, void of natural logic, suggested I leanrn how to ready a fleet of sailboats for escape. That was it. I sat there and smoked, and stared, and walked, and looked for love and reason.

There was this light from a boat house, and my skateboard without trucks, and something that did not resemble a pattern. The light kept my attention for a long time because I was afraod of entering a space I was not invited. That is what the walls around the marina said. This is still the make-believe land of Michaelville so my heart won that argument and into the light we drifted.

The skateboard was a piece of art I bought from a man on the boardwalk in Venice. It was white in most areas, I recall spots, but also a texture to the paint. It was an older styled deck, the skateboard that is, and I even remember suggesting out-loud to the artist how special the deck probably was to someone. The money exchanged hands, but so did the deck. If you still have it, cool. Thanks for the memory.

There was also a device I dropped, like I often did, but a man found it for me, found me, and returned that key. It was a bench in the marina, but before I sat down to look at the j boats secured in their places, some one else did. It was about nine ciggy buts at the foot of that bench. After taking note of this, iin some slow-motion gratitude or acknowledgement, I contributed to the thoughts they may have been thinking in a different time.

With trgard to _that_ hotel, there were a few attempts, but each time led me back to Rose. That luggage was carried on my back for several miles and one of my favorite of those miles was the time walking away from the Ritz, the luggage on my back, and this song in my ears.

Parts of the west side of Los Angeles is not and would not be possible if it were not for the United Sates Army Corps of Engineers. Ask them how they did it, but there is some pressure there for sure. I mean, there is water and there is also intent. There is not much more I can take those thoughts for now, but if that gave way, then bye bye birdie. You see, what are you going to do, though, if it is not longer maintained or the lack of maintenance busts it open one day.

These were my thoughts, but guess what? In the make-believe land of Michaelville, it seemed reasonable to suggest that the place I lived was not what I always believed it to be. Who is back there pulling those strings? There is a yellow brick road and I guess I did get to finally taok to Samson. What was the message in the Wizard of Oz?

Back on Mothers Beach, there was you, the reader, and myself, but this time a cosmonaut was stranded in orbit. Navigation towards home was not an option for her because the evil king tried repainting the face of Jesus, he ruined the source of truth for the entire planet, and there was giant boyfriuend on Earth working on a new global positioing system to save the Princes. That failed so he grabbed his skateboard and back to Rose he went.

Lonestar. Another artist sat quielty and observed the oblivion through the sunsets over the Pacific Ocean. He had a letter and they were for sale at just the right price. The artist briefly described their method of creation. For myself, that memory on Rose was tucked away along with your letter.

There are a string of shops north and south along the coast of Southern California, but if you look close enough, you will fiind what you need. The princess knew this too. She believed in her heart that her hero would find the treasures she placed for him. Maybe that was the corridor. What else was she going to do? She was up in space.

There were two lights in the sky throughout my entire journey. I first saw the pair of them in San Francisco one night during the Chrome Dev Summit in 2019. There is a picture somewhere, the original, but another it is in my other Instagram account. For some reason, I can no longer receive iCloud email due to lack of storage space. It is still not understandbale that this is a last-resort for the arbitors of truth. What is more, the authticator application, their third party _Facebook_ oauth scheme, and my backup codes cannot get me through the wall and to the truth that I wish to share with you now. It is just a photo, but is it?

Spme time after things really got hairy for boyfriend giant, there was someone that listed a phone number in case of emergency. The miracle for myself was that the phone numbers were sorted in some way, but this sort, put the 414 area code at zero. Thankfully, I never had to use it, maybe I still do, but there were other cities on there. It is enough to make me question a few things. One, someone is being hustled and it is not me and the other is someone is being hustled and it is not me. Perfect juxtaposition.
