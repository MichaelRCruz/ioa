Dear Ariana, I found some positions too. 34+35 is 69, just like the number Ted is thinking of, and just-in time for the redaction from the earhquake described in my diary.

In pasadena, I wrote about sevreal things, but at that time in the back yard by the pool in _Altadena_, I discovered way more about honesty and intent. It was there that the articulaion of my lessons through art or popular culture in America began to take place. It was cathartic. It was also my response when a man on a train to Chicago asked me about my facorite word. This was the same man that gave me a book. It was called, How to Draw what you see.

When I was in high school, I had an art teacher. The title of that book meant so much to me because that was how I was taught to draw. From that lesson so long ago, I drew faces of some of the members of The Foo Fighters and also Kurt Cobain. Since I lost access to my other Instagram account, I created this last one and named it larryandmichael. In just a few moments, You can find a picture of those drawings in both accounts. Take a look and then we can get back to the train and also my original train-of-thought, the signal.

In my diary, you will find a set of markdown articles indexed like that of an array in some programming langugaes. This just means the numbers of the pretend chapters of my diary are off by one. The funny thing is, an off-by-one error is a common cause for error in programming. If you choose to make yourself an illustration in math to help understand that, then think of it as a function that just arrived at a number or value you were not expecting. Maybe eighty-six or ninety-nine, or eighty-three, or the sum of thirty-four and thirty-five.

Anyways, 34.md is a journal entry about my thoughts on the silver linning and 35.md is the one about the earthquake that I redacted. You can still find it with _git_ or version control, but that earthquake in California, with two after-shocks, either opened up the Earth to burry a particular memory forever _or_ it opened up the Earth to seal it in time with the other rocks. After all, this is a love story.

At a certain point in my make-believe, there was a letter I mailed to Oxford hoping it would reach the Queen. Along with the letter, was a Twilio sim card and an iPhone 4. The phone was black and white like those drawings because I had it repaired when I was living in Madison. The letter was returned to sender and luckily I got it back. I used my business address in Chicago as the return address when I mailed it out of the Post Office in West Los Angeles. It is the one on Venice Blvd.

The trouble I ran into was my inability to recover that Twilio account becuase I could not afford to pay the bill at a particular point. That is the easy answer, still true, but the important part is that there were two phone numbers associated with that account: one ending in 1969 and the other ending in 1984.

You have to know that I was running from everything in my life this whole year. Everything came crashing down aroun me and my make-believe led me to create this hero iin myself that wanted to save Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. The telegraph told me about her, but more about this thing she was attacked by. In a sense, I rose to the occasion and reached out because the things the article descrbed were the similar to what I was fighting in my own life, identity theft.

She is married, says the media. Not that there is any doubt in that happiness she hopefully found, but I pretended to be her hero. Maybe there was someone I had to save even if it was just myself. You see, that is the reason I mailed that letter to Oxford. It was the only address I had over there and I am thankful I kept the one someone returned-to-sender.

In this pursuit, my identity and the battle I have been fighting to keep it can be exemplified in many forms, but since the letter to Oxford was returned to its sender, then why not the sim card and the phone. Does someone else have it? Has someone else pretended to be me in this weird way or someting else? Here is a photo of the letter. I found the mispelling of Chicago confusing and the stamp of the soccer ball amusing. After all, I have convinced myself I am stuck in this wall. Maybe that was some one signaling back. See for yourself.

As I cycle through the memories of last summer, there are several things I just cannot explain. One of these, and my favorite, was the knock at the door of the motel I stayed in from time to time on the border of Santa Monica and Venice. Rose is where this story continues and the Lone Star hotel comes into play.

Can some one verify what I paid for to stay in that room? I want to say eighty-six dollars, but if not, it was about that amount per night. The one night you need to know is when a man knocked on my door with a cell phone in hand, some cash, and plea to make something happen. He begged me to jjust call her. Just call her, he said. Please man. Just do it. He shoved the cash, the phone, and his ask towards me, but I said no. I told him I wanted to do this on my own so I put the phone and the cash back on the step of the motel door, closed that door, but failed to make cotact to whoever it was he wanted me to contact. What if it was a trick? Either way. Why did that happen? How did he know I was trying to find someone? Was it the Queen? Was it Meghan? Was it something else?

The best I can do for you, with regard to my account of that time, takes place on Rose. It also takes place further south into Venice some time before that where I met someone that could possibly be this enemy I may or may not have made up in my mind. According to my diary, I found this. I wrote it in that motel room on Rose. More make-believe if you will.

There were a few messages I left when I actually called Buckingham Palace, but you are wondering why I felt the need to do such a thing at all. The Queen, rememeber?
