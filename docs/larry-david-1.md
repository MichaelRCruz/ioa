# Larry David, pt. 1

Dear Larry, if that was all you, bravo! If not, what is going on?

There really is a _silver lining_ in life, but it took a little _make-believe_ to see it, but also something else. Last summer, in 2020, I really was at a point in my life that could relate to Bradley Cooper's character in _The Silver Linings Playbook_.

That story is just Hollywood they would say, but that story was still written by real people. It is mildly disapointing that I have to lead with that thought, but the empathy I have with those characters taught me that it can be a story of my life or your life too. Well, for demonstration purposes only that is.

In my jouranl I account for this thought, but my mind still brings me to Wicker Park and hopefully can serve as a bridge to the choice I made regarding the title of this chapter. My make-believe would not make sense wihtout Larry David, a protagonist in my story, and that is why we start there. Please do not forget this is a love story, or a rom-com, or maybe just the tale of my pursuit of happiness.

There is a few women you will meet, and just like the choice I made to cast Larry David, they too are cast as the antagonists, but what if they were not. What if the story unfolds and the reader is left convinced the girls were _actually_ the protagonists? For now, I will leave you with my account of my thoughts of the Silver Linings Playbook and what the film revealed to me one summer day in _Chicargo_.

> Despite the incomprehendable confusion in the world, there always seems to be two ways to understand something. For me, that is a satisfying explanation. I can say this will always be uncertainly true, for me. I feel as if someone out there had to remind me that the conclusions I have drawn from my work were seem to ring so true that when thinking about the three concepts of error, state, and...something else. It is interesting to wonder if we should count the unknown, lol. Maybe this is why arrays start at zero. In a way, this is the reality that exists around you, but it took an engineer to show the world the other side. Your system allowed you to function, but so did another system that may have been missed. That system functioned as well and the reveal to that truth, I hope, helps the incomprehendable confusion at any given time. It is beautiful to start imagining anything with this other way of thinking, and by virtue of that fact, the lessons I have contributed to anyone willing to listen, I hope would be the ultimate message I could share with you, but who knows? Maybe something or someone will come along and show you a fact that will change you, but what if a fact cannot change anything?

As I write this in my motel room, November 23 in 2020, you, the reader, and myself have to return to the chase or the search for completion, if you will, that led to this moment for us. My love, she is out there, but remember that this make-believe story is still all facts. These events really did happen, but allow me to begin with Larry David and that day I woke up from a nap on the home-field bench of that baseball diamond in Wicker Park.

Before that nap I was exhausted, annoyed, running, afraid, confused, paranoid, and worst of all - longing for love while on the streets in the middle of a pandemic.

That same afternoon, and in an effort to maintain my sanity, I remember trying to figure out the area under the curve of a baseball diamond. This is the diamond in Wicker Park, but I could not remmeber the distance from home to first. After all, I think it was for softball anyways, but I needed that measurement. Since I cold not remember, there was some math I could do if I had one of the other distances, maybe. I sort of gave up on that attempt and just fell asleep on the bench.

I woke up, still crabby, still homeless, still lost, but there was Larry. He was wearing a hat that was not a baseball cap, a surgical mask, but he was inside that diamond and pacing out the distance from home plate to the pitching mound. Heel to toe he began measuring that distance for us. It scared me because it meant someone was listening to me. Admitedly, I was thinking out-loud. So, if you listened close enough, you would know. It also meant they were trying to help. Why did I freak out like I did and shout at him? I guess I deserved waht was coming to me becuase Larry returned the favor and yelled back. It was muffled, of course, under that mask so I stormed off and ran to the water fountain not too far from the diamond. From there I opened my computer and began writing again.

Larry showed up a second time after I messed up the baseball thing, but this time he had a guitar and was strumming a song that I cannot remember. It was only him and I. We were sitting around the water fountain. What was going on. Why did this guy go from one place to the next just like me? It was out-of-the-ordinary enough to allow me to consider something else. Was I about to meet the love of my life in a few moments? Was Larry there as a transition to this figment of my imagination? The truth is, that is what my imagination settled on so I panicked once again and left on my skateboard. I returned with two Pepsis, two hershey bars, and two hankerchiefs. The hankerchiefs were black and white.

Almost everything inside me is saying it was not actually him that day, and it probably was something else, but it sure looked like Larry David that day. He was just hiding under his mask and hat that was not a baseball cap. Before you accuse me of being crazy, know that I already know that I am. It says psycho on my luggaeg. If you still do not like me, then yuo have already forgotten that this is all make-believe. In other words, the way I can tell these stories is by pretending. This is a love story.

What is a hopeless romantic? Is that me? Why do I have this soul that brought me to this point of my life? Why do I feel abandoned in terrible ways I cannot understand or refuse to accept? Where are all my friends? Why does _America_, the Allen Ginsberg poem come to mind as I write in this motel room with five leaves left?

As this all unfolds, you, the reader, and myself will have fewer questions as the details begin to _take shape_. There are other characters you need to know. One is the Queen of England and another is Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex. I thought she was in trouble so I sent a letter to somebody in Oxford. Along with that letter was a package. In that package was a cell phone. It was the only address I had of someone over there, but the hopeless romantic in me led to the belief that it was just part of my odyssey - my attempt to make it home to my love.

Am I saying that is her? Maybe, but in reality, she exists. Maybe she actually did get my signal, and through time or prayer, and this is just how I am supposed to find her - my book. Maybe it originally was her, maybe she gave up, but maybe someone else had to come to the rescue. Maybe that was Larry David.

There is way more to the Larry David story that you will get later, but for a little comic relief, know that I too sat on a super tiny piece of Ramen noodle on that same bench from before in Wicker on a differrnt day while trying to write. A ramen noodle that was so well-placed and innoculous as a prank that it just stuck with me. The confusing part is that I guess I dreamt of the YouTube video where someone else described the same prank because I cannot find it. I guess I will just have to pretend I watched a video like that, but if this is any concellation, here is another video of that schmuck on Conan.

I can still hear Bill Murray warning me that no one will believe me like that post on Reddit. Look it up.

Dear Larry, if that was all you, bravo! If not, what is going on?
