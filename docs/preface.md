# Preface

Cl arity for us is like a piece of beautifully etched glass created from the sands within our heartbeats that bind two facts of life together, her and I, in rhythm and rhyme turning in dance towards the conflagration following the one last time.

I have to introduce myself otherwise someone else will do that for me and they most likely already have. All of my grandparents have now passed away, but there is one that I never met because she lived and died before my time. My mother did not talk about my grandmother very often. In private, she was very open about the death of her own mother, but she would discuss her passing only when asked. I will always have that angel looking over me.

I prayed in this way as a kid where I would just talk to her out loud towards heaven. I would ramble on and on for hours. It felt very real and it made me feel better about anything.

The second time I felt close to God was towards the end of my days of drug abuse. Drugs destroyed the lives of several of my friends. Some of them died - even one very recently, and then another.

In my early twenties, the contemplation of my moral existance brought me to Christ one afternoon that I cherish, and almost would share with you now, but there is no possible way to share that experience. Think about the extent to whihch I could describe that series of moments in writing or in any other medium. The reasoning behind that comes down to you and I, but it is the two of us that a writer, or an artist, or a musician must create for that connection to occur. Therefore, since this is a book and everything I have witnssed so far will always come to an end, another attempt to descrie the day I was born again will give life to anoher medium that contains my art.

This next part will be the most difficult time ~~of~~ in my life to describe or admit to you, but if possible, a reach towards journalist David Carr is making this possible for me, as well as others that tell similar stories. The story of his life was made available to me through a documentary I found one day and enjoyed more than once. There is a scene with him and media _something_ VICE trying to be all bad-ass with each other, but that is just the humorous part being the nature of the friction that we find everywhere between generations of time.

David Carr's book, _The Night of the Gun_, was a story that retrospectively provided confort in a transition in my life into college. The reason is that, like David Carr or David of the Bible, despite the difficulty in achieving success, that success came to fruition, and peronally, was a set of facts over time that I could emphathize with for any conceivable eternity.

I had an apartment on 18th and Beacher Street on Milwaukee's south-side that I could hardly pay rent for. That was a time when I was in the thick-of-things in my early twenties. I was stealing from retail stores, doing drugs, and basically anything that didn't require a moral compass. It was a pretty different time back then, but also just a sample. However, that experience and those memories still yields plenty of regret.

The truth for me is that the miscalculation by perceiving those memories as regret is a difficult process and is something both Davids must experienced. The part of the struggle is someting that I like to imagine is somehow communicated to us in the Bible and probbaly found in the story of David and Goliath. This year of 2020 approaching December, is a time that I can premptively share with you because the words in the outline I drafted in my travel journal I nicknamed _las-noticias_ will sevre as the bricks of the house I build and also the words in these essays.

This past year will be recorded in history as a signifcant time in history by many. By virtue of that assumption, I would like to make an attempt to recollect my memories in this manuscript called _Silicon Beach_ to serve as. at least, one testament to the existance of the spirits within me and also the existance of God.

There is a motel or temporary space, and many more backwards in time, that I am inhabitng in this moment in time. I am shy to admit that at each place of rest I hoped to find her there or that she would knock at the door of my hotel room one day. The best part is that I am not alone in this Singularity we are experiencing together. Please take that thought lightly because I can be awdully dramatic or romantic in my moments of recollection. There is anxiety that comes with that realization that must be from something, or somewhere, or some one of some significance. Logic mixed with the angels and angles found in the architecture I see in life can sometimes be harmful or hurtful depending on my perception, your perception, and the readers.

One thing that remains true in my life is the gap of approximatey ten-years-time that I introspectively gained or retrospectively lost or vice-versa or verse-visa. Maybe we could consider vice-verse or versa-visa. Those words are an example of, in jest of course, how I find a lot of my logic to illuminate paths through imagination, but recently I am realizing something.

This personal phenomenom occurring with myself, and only myself, is probably something that some mights be perceiving in not-so-desirable ways. As for the unknown others, they seem to have an ability to emphathize with my words or even existence. They have to exist by virtue of the prior group.

In a more abstract sense if that will help any of you to find your way. The experiences that shape us also exist in the shapes themselves that experience the laws of nature.

Maybe geometry will help illustrate some of my thoughts for you, the reader, and myself, but that is just a language of concepts you learn in geometry class, or learn with a box of crayons, or learn with the jib of a sailboat cut just the perfect way. Romanticaly speaking, they are all signals of my existance. As I float in these clouds of mine while hoping to find my love one day, I imagine myself saying something cute - I like the cut of your jib.Or something else. Hey, Honey.

In an effort to write this preface, please accept my desire to be included in this world of writers, or artists or other various mediums or buffers we all enjoy when the luxury to do so presents itself iin time. It is my responsibility, then, to provide some structure to my logic and love. A way to do this for you, the reader, and myself is to provide these three spaces: error, state, and ~~null~~ something else.

The words that exist between the seams of those three dimensios, spaces, or concepts contain a **signal**. Ultimately in a tangible form, they will be the abstracted journal entries found in _las-noticias_ that I recorded in 2020, but the important part is as follows.

As an appeal to the collective emotion of all the artists out there, please make room for me to reach the love of my life. She is there, somewhere, but hopefully she is in this time and on this planet. The same tme and the same planet where this motel exists and also where, myslef by myself, _currently_ exists.

There is a deadline of seven days in this motel that I gave myself to bring this stage of work towards some asymptotic completion. The urgency is real because I want it to be. As for the people that find this collection of essays, only you can build the wire to conduct my **signal** into oblivion for her and I.

In the spirit of transparency, know that those journal entries will be reworded if needed, expanded upon, added to, but ultimately abstracted into a collection of cherry-picked essays that I will pile up into those three separate spaces. A diligent effort will be made to cite the artists I plan to refernce in those conceptual essays and also a call to the hands above to make room for all this light to reach my corresponding fact of life and for her to tune in to me - her corresponding fact of life.

The method I hope to share my three spaces of essays can only be presented by means of my current _sponsor_, Github. 
(https://github.com/MichaelRCruz) for now. There you will also find, for identification purposes, the private repository that holds _las-noticias_.

For some _pNoid_ reason, I feel obligated to tell you that the laptop that drafted almost all of those journal entries was stolen out of my green bag in an underground train station on Blue Line in Chicago, namely Division. It is located under a little park within _Wicker Park_ that had the water fountain that was _actually_ running while the one in _actual_ Wicker Park was not moving water at all. If that is difficult to follow, then plesse just know those water fountains symbolize something valuable to me.

Another _pNoid_ inclination towards these efforts of mine has me share with you, the reader, and myself the story about a pair of shoes I wore on one particular stretch of my imaginative journey. Back on Earth, they are just a pair of shoes I lost, again in Chicago, that I had tied together by the laces that I carried for a few blocks in Logan Square. Those pair of shoes were part of a set of three that were gifted to me as a Christmas present one year, but the interesting part is the company that designed those shoes, Greats, mistakenly sent three of the same pair and I kept them all.

My story begins to unfold, then, when I consider that it may have been no mistake at all that I received three pairs. Maybe there was some intention on their part to help my life reach the completion I have been marching for all my life and three paits of all-white American sneakers was her efforts to help close the loop or resolve this paradox of love I am experiencing.

These essays are pretend, but they are also somethng else. They are facts in writing. There will be plenty of imagination used in these essays for her to locate me. This is her atlas that once were the maps drawn from what I could see.

Clarity for us is like a piece of beautifully etched glass created from the sands within our heartbeats that bind two facts of life together, her and I, in rhythm and rhyme turning in dance towards the conflagration following the one last time.
