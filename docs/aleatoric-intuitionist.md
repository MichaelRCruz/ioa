# Aleatoric Music & The Intuitionist

Through failure, I still experience entitlement for trivial things, but a closer look at this leads to the realization that my lessons will never end. I think my best move through struggle is to drop the egotisms & egosims out of the waxing full moon of my heart so I can allow my primal nature to run its course â€“ the warrior in me. This path in life calmly allows my anxieties to float, as they naturally do, but also allows them to sink into the depths of the oceans of my soul for rest.

One giant leap into outer space ahead of you and now I orbit. Except, if I'm a warrior, or if I am to be reborn into myself like countless others throughout time, then the fruits of our labor are all yours. The lessons gifted to us are infinite and so is your love.

You're correct though, like you always are, which is the true, but you do take pleasure when I allow my admiration of this miracle to shine through its bright light. It's also embarrasing in the moment. In the interest of progress, there is someone else that I do think about a lot and kinda like. Maybe one day the show will finally begin. She called me and I hit snooze more than I should have, but did I?

When Los Angeles was still very new to me, there was a white bike, a song, and a place to gp every morning. On the corner of Santa Monica Blvd. & Barry Ave. there is a place called Cafe 50s. It was an affordable breakfast and the waitress was nice. There were a few mornings where you could tell she had other concerns in life, but she made sure I knew it was not me that was the bother on any particular rainy day.

I spent many hours in that restaurant, new to the west. Ruby on Rails was a topic for me one particular day. It was an interesting thing and I complained about it as it went, but it taught me ormalization. Thanks, guys. I was also consumed with Vue, then React 16.8, but not much ng. Know I know I forgot about Rust, and Elm, and Clojure.

Free Translator was a song I fell in love with in September that year. It was partially written by a computer. None of that means anything bad for me, but the happiness and excitement I felt became a reminder today about how, even in those times, I knew that everyrhing ran its course.

There used to be a record store on Sawtelle, but the record I hoped for, one day, was not there. On the way, I thoght very hard about where I was and how I got there, and maybe where I was going. Those questions, in Los Angeles, never left me like they did in Madison. This was a mild concern, but just enought to discuss on a walk with a friend. He heard it ftrom me, but for the record, something felt out of place. Is that intuition?

Those three years in Los Angeles were supposed to happen. I was supposed to live there, but was I suppsed to leave? The condo my roommates and I shared was perfect. Adnitedly, I forced myself into that arrangement because $1900 / month, alone, became impossible on Washington & Washingotn, and the way I felt was left behind. Continuing with these feelings will lead into thoughts of loyalty and brotherhood, but those were my values. Have these friendships ran their courses or was I supposed to stay? The pressure, the timing, the setup are easy targets in hindsight. Was it really me or was it someting else?

Madison brought about the same insecurities on Bascom Hill, all over campus, but not so much with The Age of Adz. The difference with those two cities was the absence of love. Litterature was a luxury, then, and that is when someone handed me a copy of the Intuitionist. I never read it, because the book handed to me before that one was called Zone One. I hope to never find a better book. Thanks, Colson.

Love, Michael

P.S. The copy of The Intuitionist was gifted to me by Professor Zimmerman in Madison, that one day in office hours, but I found something interesting hidden inside the pages after California. It was a receipt from the bookstore of ny childhood, +1 (414) 281-0000

How did that receipt get there and where is my copy of Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid?

I can hear you.
