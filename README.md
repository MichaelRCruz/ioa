In support of [reactfire](https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/reactfire), anyone should feel free to contribute in the spirit of open source software. The project began as an exploration into the features available in React starting with version 16.8. Firebase offered more than enough to produce a minimal chat application for all web platforms. The development choices are _led_ by the best practices described within [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org), in [firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com), and made possible by [cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com).

Aside from the pivotal role ioa plays in service to its supersystem of apps, there are some thoughts in development on ioa's goals, purpose, and overall concept in this documentation.
