# ioa

[ioa.chat](https://ioa.chat)

This project began as an exploration into the features made avilable in React starting with version 16.8. Firebase's ecosytem offered more than enough tooling and documentation to produce a minimal and fully-featured chat application for all web platforms. The development choices are _led_ by the best practices described within [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org), within [firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com), and within [cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com).

In support of [reactfire](https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/reactfire), ioa intends to remain a chat app, but the community should feel free to contribute in the spirit of [open source](https://opensource.org). ‚ù§Ô∏è

A particular interest was taken with ioa's authentication system whereby a common list of user configurations serves as the source of truth for any user intent. Since ioa's design allows the user to maintain several [auth](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) providers associated with their account, the thought was to utilize any tokens or keys made avaiable by each of those potential auth choices to the user's advantage. For example, integrate a [mini app](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/mini-apps)!

The most value this approach yields, appears to be the scaleability it produces for the system surrounding it. The list of user configurations is able to serve as a centralized source of truth for, not only ioa, but also any affiliate iOS, Android, or web application under the same project ID. It still remains unclear how flexible the scope each app has via HTTP with respect to the location of ioa in the Firebase supersystem (roll with it).

This idea has been done already, but ioa's significance is illuminated by the user-friendliness and speed of development. Firebase makes these technologies avilable for less sophisticated systems and helps with the overall distribution of information.
