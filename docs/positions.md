# Positions

Have you ever had a question and knew the correct answer in the future? For me, that is relief from momentary despair followed by a sense of inevitability.

Does a build process follow the same direction as the design pattern in any conceivable way? There was a consideration of union and intersection, but the utility of even and odd numbers can answer that. A three-sided pyramid is disqualified and the four-sided gains significance.

Connect two spots with a taut line. The lines will collect to reveal an object resembling a cube.

In an effort to understand the significance of cubed properties, then run a diff on the sequence of form until the cusp of simplicity is acheived.

It seems that I have found two building blocks. One for life and the other for not-life. These two objects build the map, do the dance, and march through an infinite oblivion.

## First Position

Think of one spot as a point of reference, but make two spots in total and then connect them with a line. This is your drum beat in one dimension, length.

Draw what you see

## Second Position

The second drum beat is similar because you now duplicate what you see and connect the two lines and connect those spots. You now have a square with two dimensions, length and width.

Draw what you see

## Third Position

The third beat of the drum duplicates your square and the builder connects those spots. You now have a cube with three dimensions: length, width, and height.

Draw what you see

## Fourth Position

This last one, hopefully, will help you see time as the next dimension that resembles movement through space. You now have a vector.

## Termination (?)

Time and process have an end in this system, but they are different.

For me, there are two ways to compare two different objects, but the strategy is to maintain the expectations of one while the second tries to mock.

If you can visualize a _cubed_ linear growth pattern, it approaches infinity in six potential directions. The pyramid has five potential directions. Only one of the pyramid directions _can_ lead to infinity, but the other four sides are not asymptotic nor will they find infinity. There is completion.

Protip: To be sound, account for the centrifically oriented base of these objects. So, for now, all your base are belong to us.

I discovered a pattern with these two objects, but the properties inside them contain the difference I was hoping to find.

Information Oriented Architecture
If you are familiar with paralax you will know your way around space in three dimensions, but the physics of light and the intellectual interpretation of it, really is the first lens of any telescope you look through for all human senses.

What if we could build a telescope with different limitatons? One that is exactly like the spotfyed cube in your imagination? We could use eddison bulbs that formed a cube large enough to perfectly fit the Earth inside. The challenge, then, becomes vibing the eight satellites with the rotation of life. In other words, their location must change as if it were breathing with Earth.

Eddison bulbs have this interesting property that I can only understand with the contrast I observe with the kind of light that can be used to measure paralax. This is the same light as the sun. Eddison bulbs just look different to me.

A boat just moments before it sails through the eye of the wind has two lights. The edison light is always port and stern while the starboard light is bow. The camera will capture the edison light and the seams of the universe.

The point they all intersect has more than four lines of deliniation. This means it is not the corner of a four sided cube or I am unable to accurately mesaure the division for that _corner_. My suspicion is that at least one other edison light is required to end the first position if spots in imagination represented edison bulbs.

The extent of this for me is the observation of the starboard light and the silhouette it creates. The beams of port light have another vector and I think it is illuminating some other side, but why does port still have an afterglow?

## Juxtaposition

Would the utility of two objects have an absolute value greater than zero? Try to find a song in the processing pattern of a four-sided pyramid and a cube.

The visualization is quite illuminating if you can imagine a pair of dice, but round both to perfection so basically a sphere to place inside each of the two objects. Each sphere has these assumed properties allowing them no friction especially at bounce.

With a simple movement each ball will find a place inside the shape that would look like a ball bouncing off at least one surface that is perpendicular to the vector of the ball. For the pyramid, there is one point of interest and for the cube there is infinite points of interest.

Now that both the pyramid and the cube are vibing, the most astonishing truth is the pyramid can cease to vibe with a simple rotation in time and gravity.

The best demonstration of this initial start is to _imagine_ a cube next to a pyramid on Earth becuase of one reason, gravity. If a giant person politely tipped the pyramid to the side as well as the cube, then which ball is the only one that still has a chance to remain dancing?

If you are asking what happend to the base of the pyramid, then I would say it is still there, but you cannot see the hinge to the door. The tilt started the process and the removal of one wall will end the vibe of one of the objects with certainty and the other object is left to chance.

Light has bilatteral movement and the idea of it moving the other direction is enough for me. If you can record one direction, then the other is free.
